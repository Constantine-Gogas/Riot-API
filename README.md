#Riot Games Match Data Analysis

###This project uses the Riot Games API combined with Python to collect and analyze match data from games played by my friend and me over the last two years. The raw data is processed and then visualized in Tableau to uncover insights about gameplay, champion performance, and win rates.

##Key features:

    Automated data extraction from Riot Games API

    Data cleaning and transformation using Python (pandas)

    Visualization of player and match statistics using Tableau dashboards

    Focus on personal gameplay history for detailed analysis

Perfect for League of Legends players or data enthusiasts interested in exploring match statistics and trends through hands-on data science.
