# Riot Games Match Data Analysis

This project uses the Riot Games API combined with Python to collect and analyze match data from games played by my friend and me over the last two years. The raw data is processed and then visualized in Tableau to uncover insights about gameplay, champion performance, and win rates.

## Key features: 

1. Automated data extraction from Riot Games API using Python

2. Data cleaning and transformation using Python (pandas)

3. Visualization of player and match statistics using Tableau dashboards
